The ExoGAN code is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained to perform atmospheric retrievals of transmission spectra of exoplanets. ExoGAN can easily be modified to train on a diverse range of problems.

These sets of pages will be populated with installation instructions and how-to tutorials. If you have a specific question, please email Tiziano Zingales (tiziano.zingales.15 (at) ucl.ac.uk) or Ingo Waldmann (ingo (at) star.ucl.ac.uk).



## Code repository

ExoGAN is available on GitHub:

the training data (10 million transmission spectra) can be found here:
