Here we have collected some of the most frequently asked questions on the software. 

1. Q: What is the difference between `default.par` and our customised `.par` file? 
   
   A: To run TauREx one would need to provide a lot of parameters and minor settings. To relieve us from specifying everything each time, the default.par file holds the default settings of TauREx. Your customised `.par` file, stores the parameters or settings that you wish TauREx to use instead of the default ones. TauREx will then look into the `default.par` file for the default settings for any unspecified parameters or settings in your own `.par` file.
