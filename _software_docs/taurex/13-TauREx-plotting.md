If you run `taurex.py` with the `--plot` flag. It will generate a standard set of plots in your `Output` folder.
These are:

File | Description
--- | ---
nest_posterior.pdf | The posterior distribution corner plot
nest_spectrum.pdf   | The input spectrum with the best fitting model
nest_spectrum_contrib_solX.pdf | The best fit model's individual opacity contributions
nest_tp_profile.pdf | The temperature-pressure profile fitted (only generated automatically for emission)

Should `taurex.py` find multiple solutions to a spectrum (assuming `[MultiNest] > multimodes = True`), then these are automatically superimposed with different colours on the same plots.

Additional plots (e.g. vertical abundance profiles) can be generated by running the `taurex_plots.py` routine on the corresponding `nest_out.pickle` file. To generate all available plots:

```python
python tools/taurex_plots.py --db_dir [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] --plot_all
```

where `--db_dir` is the directory containing the `nest_out.pickle` file. For a full list of plotting options:

```python
python tools/taurex_plots.py --help
```
