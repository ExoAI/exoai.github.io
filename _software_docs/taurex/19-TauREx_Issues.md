## Compiling Issues

This session includes error messages that may arise when compiling c++ packages, i.e. when using the command:

sh compile.sh
```

1. Q: I received warnings when I was compiling the .cpp files, should I worry?
   
   A: As long as you have the corresponding .so files, then everything should be okay.


2. Q: fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory

   A: For Mac OS users: this issue may arise if your xcode is not up-to-date, please open the terminal and type:
   ```
   xcode-select install
   ```
   For users who have recently upgraded to Mac OS Mojave, if the above solution doesn't work, one could try the following commend:

   ```
