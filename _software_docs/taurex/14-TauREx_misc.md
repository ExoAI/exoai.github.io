There are various other, more specialised modes available to run TauREx, how to generate forward models or use the TauREx output. This page tries to capture the most commonly used.

## High-resolution cross sections (R = 1,000,000)

## Disequilibrium chemistry inputs

External input files for temperature-pressure profiles and chemical abundance profiles can be provided using the following routine

```python
create_spectrum_chemprofile.py
```

We will add documentation for this mode soon. If you want to use it, please just email ingo@star.ucl.ac.uk for now.
