Just a quick note that we will be co-hosting the first exoplanet workshop focused on code development for exoplanet atmospheric studies. The workshop called Digital Exoplanets (website: [http://www.digitalexoplanets.org](http://www.digitalexoplanets.org)) will be held in Prague on the 27th - 30th of January. It will hopefully be the first of a series of workshops in 2019/20 to address code development in the field.
